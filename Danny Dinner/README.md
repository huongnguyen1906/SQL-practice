# Danny-s-Restaurant
This refers to a case study to practice MSSQL. All the dataset and sources belong can be found here https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/

Scenario: Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
